    This project started out as a short video in response to the ‘Note to Self’ brief put out by Glimpse. The project acted as a reminder to our future self to stick to our values, particularly in regards to the environment, that are tested as we enter the professional world.

    After being shortlisted from roughly 200 entries, we developed the work into an installation where sandcastles displaying commandment style messages of common environmental values. The sandcastles represented a reminder of our youth when values are often prioritised, yet are fragile under the pressure of professional life. Visitors were encouraged to build and crush their own sandcastles whilst visiting the exhibition.
